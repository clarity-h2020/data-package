<td>MANDATORY</td>
<td>A resource MUST contain a name property. The name is a simple name or identifier to be used for this resource.
 
If present, the name MUST be unique amongst all resources in this data package.
It MUST consist only of lowercase alphanumeric characters plus ""."", ""-"" and ""_"".
It would be usual for the name to correspond to the file name (minus the extension) of the data file the resource describes.
The name SHOULD be invariant, meaning that it SHOULD NOT change when a data package is updated, unless the new package version should be considered a distinct package, e.g. due to significant changes in structure or interpretation. Version distinction SHOULD be left to the version property. As a corollary, the name also SHOULD NOT include an indication of time range covered.</td>

Currently, CLARITY Data Package only supports the following resource formats:
 * Tabular data:
    - Comma Separated Values (.csv)
 * Vector based:
    - GeoJson (.geojson)
    - ESRI Shapefiles (.shp)
    - OGC GeoPackage (.gpkg). 
 * Raster based:
    - Geotiff (.tif, .tiff)
 
Note: the use of GeoPackages allows to overcome the limitations of ESRI Shapefiles (Check the list of limitations at http://switchfromshapefile.org/ and https://www.gis-blog.com/geopackage-vs-shapefile) and therefore, its use in Data Packages should be preferrable. Nevertheless, when using GeoPackages as resources within the Data Packages, in order to comply with the Data Package specification, take into account that a resource of this type can only have ONE dataset within the GeoPackage (although its specification allows having one or more different datasets).</td>

<tr>
<td><i><b>bytes</b></i></td>
<td>Long</td>
<td>0/1</td>
<td>OPTIONAL</td>
<td>OPTIONAL</td>
<td>Size of the file in bytes. 

Note: This parameter is hepful for determining how to process the Data Package, thus for instance, if we know in advance that several of the resources are large, we can determine that it is better to process the contents in a batch process and later on inform the user when the results are ready.
In this sense, the parameter is considered MANDATORY if the resource is included within the Data Package (the path parameter points to a local file within the Data Package), whereas it is considered OPTIONAL if the path parameter points to a remote location (e.g., HTTP request to a WFS service or ftp location). This is so because the size of the resource is unknown until it is requested to the server hosting it."

<tr>
<td><i><b>path</b></i></td>
<td>url-path character string without length restriction</td>
<td>0/1</td>
<td>OPTIONAL</td>
<td>MANDATORY</td>
<td>"Location property for data in files located online or locally on disk (within the Data Package itself).
 
The path property MUST be a string -- or an array of strings (see "Data in Multiple Files"). Each string MUST be a "url-or-path" string, defined as the following:
 * URLs MUST be fully qualified. MUST be using either http or https scheme. (Absence of a scheme indicates MUST be a POSIX path)
 * POSIX paths (unix-style with / as separator) are supported for referencing local files, with the security restraint that they MUST be relative siblings or children of the descriptor. Absolute paths (/) and relative parent paths (../) MUST NOT be used, and implementations SHOULD NOT support these path types.
 
Examples:
 * fully qualified url
   - "path": "http://ex.datapackages.org/big-csv/my-big.csv"
   - "path": "http://demo.geo-solutions.it/geoserver/tiger/ows?service=WFS&version=1.1.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=tiger:tiger_roads&srsName=EPSG:3857&bbox=40.7,-74,40.8,-73,urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4326&maxFeatures=1"

 * relative path (note: this will work both as a relative path on disk and on online)
   - "path": "data/my-csv.csv"
 
 
SECURITY: / (absolute path) and ../ (relative parent path) are forbidden to avoid security vulnerabilities when implementing data package software. These limitations on resource path ensure that resource paths only point to files within the data package directory and its subdirectories. This prevents data package software being exploited by a malicious user to gain unintended access to sensitive information.
 
Data in Multiple Files: Usually, a resource will have only a single file associated to it. However, sometimes it may be convenient to have a single resource whose data is split across multiple files -- perhaps the data is large and having it in one file would be inconvenient.
To support this use case the path property MAY be an array of strings rather than a single string: "path": [ "myfile1.csv", "myfile2.csv" ]
It is NOT permitted to mix fully qualified URLs and relative paths in a path array: strings MUST either all be relative paths or all URLs.
 
Best Practice (proposal): dataset resources MUST be located in a ""data"" folder in the root of the in a Data Package (where the json descriptor is also located) in order to have a better organization of the contents. Within the data folder, datasets MAY be further organized creating additional subfolders if necessary.</td>

<tr>
<td><i><b>schema</b></i></td>
<td>url-path character string without length restriction</td>
<td>0/1</td>
<td>OPTIONAL</td>
<td>MANDATORY</td>
<td>In CLARITY Data Packages, a Data Resource MUST always have a schema property to describe the schema of the resource data.

Note: even for raster-based resources, having the schema is necessary, as it can describe useful information like what is/are the paremeter(s) measured as well as its/their measurement unit(s), which may be necessary for the application in charge of process the resource afterwards.
 
The value for the schema property on a resource MUST be an object representing the schema OR a string that identifies the location of the schema.
If a string it must be a url-or-path as defined above, that is a fully qualified http URL or a relative POSIX path. The file at the location specified by this url-or-path string MUST be a JSON document containing the schema.
 
The next section provide a complete schema description with the parameters for each of the typical resources included in a CLARITY Data Package.</td>
